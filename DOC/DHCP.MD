## Dynamic Host configuration Protocol (DHCP)

- DHCP is a network protocol used to automate the process of assigning IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices, like subnet mask, default gateway and DNS server addresses.  

## Working of DHCP
### The 8 DHCP messages 
1. **DHCP discovers a message**: generated by the client and broadcasted to all devices in order to discover if there is any DHCP server/servers are present in a network or not.

2. **DHCP offers a message**: The server will respond to the client by broadcasting a message specifying unleased (not used) IP address and other other TCP configuration information.  

3. **DHCP request message**: The client revieves the offer message, it responds by broadcasting a DHCP request message, ti find out if there is any other host present in the network with the same IP address, if there is no reply from another host, a message will be broadcasted to the server showing the acceptance of the IP aaddress.  

4. **DHCP Acknowledgment Message**: In response to the request message, the server will make an entry with a specified client ID and bind the IP address.
